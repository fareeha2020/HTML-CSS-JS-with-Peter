    <p>About four weeks before the start of each semester, you will be allocated a personal timetable for the semester based on the units of study you've selected. This will be available on the personal timetable website.
<br>
        There are three stages to getting your final timetable:
        <ul>
       <li> you enter class preferences before timetables are released</li>
       <li> your timetable is emailed to you, about four weeks before the start of Semester 1 and Semester 2</li>
       <li>you can log in and change your timetable up until the end of Week 2 of the semester </li></ul>
        Once your timetable is available, log in to the personal timetable website and select <a href="/view.html">'View current timetable'</a> <br>
        You can view your timetable either as a table in classic view or as a list in schedule view.</p>
