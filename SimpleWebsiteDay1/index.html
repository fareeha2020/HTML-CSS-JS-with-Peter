    <h1 id=1>Getting your Timetable</h1>
    <p>About four weeks before the start of each semester, you will be allocated a personal timetable for the semester based on the units of study you've selected. This will be available on the personal timetable website.
        <br>
                There are three stages to getting your final timetable:
                <ul>
               <li> you enter class preferences before timetables are released</li>
               <li> your timetable is emailed to you, about four weeks before the start of Semester 1 and Semester 2</li>
               <li>you can log in and change your timetable up until the end of Week 2 of the semester </li></ul>
                Once your timetable is available, log in to the personal timetable website and select <a href="/view.html">'View current timetable'</a> <br>
                You can view your timetable either as a table in classic view or as a list in schedule view.</p>
               
    <h1 id=2>Change your Timetable</h1>
    <p>Once your timetable is available through the personal timetable website, you may be able to make changes to it. This can be done up until timetables are locked at the end of the second week of classes.
        <br>
        It’s important to be aware that once you’ve made changes to your timetable, there is no option to return it to its previous version. You may be able to obtain your previous class times by changing your new one but this will depend on availability.
        <br>
        In many cases, it might not be possible to make changes because of class availability, timetable clashes or departmental restrictions.<br>
    </p>
        <h2>Change a Single class</h2>
    <p> Change a single class
        You can request to change to a specific class. Where possible, you will be moved into your requested class and the rest of your current timetable will remain unchanged. Be aware that once a change is made, you may not be able to change back to your previous timetable.</p>

<h1 id=3>Synching your Timetable</h1>
<p>The feed is updated whenever your timetable changes.
    <br>
    To turn on or activate your calendar feed, log into the personal timetable page and select 'Access my timetable in calendar format'. Follow the instructions to activate your feed and generate a unique URL that you can add to your preferred calendar application. Make sure you subscribe to your calendar feed to automatically receive updates.
    <br>
    You can view, deactivate or regenerate your unique link at any time by logging in to the personal timetable page and selecting 'Access my timetable in calendar format'.<br></p>
    <h2>Calendar feed security</h2>
    <p>
        Please be aware that calendar feeds are not password protected. Anybody with your calendar link can view it.
        <br>
        If you believe someone has gained unauthorised access to your calendar feed, you can deactivate the feed or regenerate your unique link. If you regenerate a new link, any old links will no longer work.</p>
